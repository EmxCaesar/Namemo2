This repository contains the source code and data used for the paper:

**"Enhancing Teacher-Student Interaction: A Vision-based Name-indicating System Using Advanced Image Processing Techniques"**

The code consists of two main components: **WebServer** and **SmartClass**. The **SmartClass** component includes functionalities such as camera control, image stitching, and face recognition. The **WebServer** component waits for client requests, and upon receiving a request, it coordinates with the **SmartClass** component to complete the tasks, generate a panoramic image (pano), and send it back to the client.
